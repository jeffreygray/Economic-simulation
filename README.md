# Economic Simulation in Ruby

This project is a Ruby simulation of a basic economic system. It includes classes for households, firms, workers, unions, cooperatives, and unpredictable events like natural disasters and strikes.

## Structure

The simulation includes the following classes:

- `Household`: Represents a household with income and consumption. Households can work and consume goods.
- `Firm`: Represents a firm with production and labor cost. Firms can produce goods, hire workers, and sell goods.
- `Worker`: Represents a worker with hours of work and wage. Workers can work for a firm.
- `Union`: Represents a workers' union that can collectively bargain for better wages.
- `Cooperative`: Represents a workers' cooperative that operates a firm. 
- `Chaos`: Represents unpredictable events that can disrupt the economy, such as natural disasters and strikes.
